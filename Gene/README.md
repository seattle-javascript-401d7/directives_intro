# Nested Directives

##Description
This app has two directives, one contained within the the other.
It generates a list of tasks I need to accomplish before my brother in law moves in. These directives communicate with one another through a link function and a require field.

##Running it
1. Clone it and npm install.
2. Navigate to the root directory (which is "Gene")
3. Run gulp (default task will webpack and lint it)
4. Launch server
5. Check it out on localhost:5000
